### About me
For the support of my private IT setup as well as out of technical interest I am working on several private projects. In the hope they may be of use to others as well I make them available as open source.

### Projects
This is the list of my GitHub hosted projects. Go to the project pages to get more details.

 * [CertMgr](http://certmgr.carne.de) - Java/JavaFX application for creating and maintaining X.509 certificates.
 * [phpLogMon](https://github.com/hdecarne/phplogmon) - A PHP based log file monitor and analysis tool. While generally working this project is not under active development right now and will be superseded by the LogMon application (see below).
 * [FileScanner](http://www.filescanner.org) - Java application for scanning and decoding of file data. The current version is hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/filescanner/). Development of the next version will take place here.
 * [Gentoo Extras](https://github.com/hdecarne/gentoo-extras-overlay) - I use [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org/) for running my linux boxes and maintain some custom for ebuilds for that.
