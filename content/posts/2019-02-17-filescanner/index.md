Did you ever wonder what is inside a file. The FileScanner tool is capable to detect and decode several file formats even recursively.
Data structures can be inspected in detail. Contained data can be viewed or exported.

This makes FileScanner a suitable tool for those who want to see a file's details or want to get a better understanding of a file format.

A beta version of the completely rewritten 2.x version is now [available](https://github.com/hdecarne-github/filescanner/releases/latest).

Main enhancements are:
* A new generic format specification driven [scan engine](https://github.com/hdecarne-github/filescanner-engine).
* Ad-hoc full-text search support via [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org).
* Native Installer, Launcher and automatic update support via [Install4J](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html).

See the [FileScanner](https://www.filescanner.org) home page for further details.
